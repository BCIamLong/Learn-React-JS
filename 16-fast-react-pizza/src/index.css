/* *this is the way we create the reuse class in Tailwind with this way we can reuse our style
! but of course it's not good because we throw the most of things Tailwind features Tailwind provide for us right we come back to CSS
* but we shouldn't use this way so this is the last solution if we can't create the reuse component
* so instead use this way we can create reuse component with react component and use it right 

* if we don't have choice and we can't create reuse component this is the way we can do but keep in mind in the last solution when we have no choice
* so this way of creating new classes by composing many other together with apply should really be exception and not the rule
* but it's important to know it and when we met this in the other codebase we don't confuse right
* but as we said that if we can't create reuse component and maybe with other situation this way can be use in Tailwind for those situations
